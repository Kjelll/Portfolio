### Galactinder
Alien Dating Simulator with an honorable mention by the gamejam jury 

Procedural generation of 2D aliens (up to 36000), creating all of the UI necessary for the dating sim, game design. 

The first part of the game about a dating app with procedural aliens was designed and programmed by [Feli](https://twitter.com/Niodith), Leo and me, with great art made by [Kris](https://twitter.com/kris_weinand).

The second part, travelling to the date as a 2D spaceship minigame was made by two other games engineer students.

The procedural name generation with 5400 permutations I quickly hacked together is a great example of how a little can achieve a lot.
